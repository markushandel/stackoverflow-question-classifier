        "body": "<p>What are the benefits and drawbacks of choosing a buffsize that is larger (or smaller) than needed when working with sockets?</p>\n<p>Consider my specific case as an example, I am using UNIX stream sockets in python to implement basic IPC for an app I am working on. There is one &quot;server&quot; process, and many &quot;client&quot; processes. The client processes connect to the server process's socket and send it commands. The server process receives those commands and executes them. The protocol they use is very simple, and the only notable rule is that each command must end with a semicolon.</p>\n<p>The clients can send as many or as few commands as they'd like in each message (even a partial command, where the rest of the command and the accompanying semicolon are included in a future message). The server processes and stores messages in a queue until it receives a semicolon, then it saves the completed command to a queue.</p>\n<p>The point of describing my simple example is to illustrate that in terms of information transfer, the buffsize argument passed to socket.recv() is completely irrelevant. i.e. I can call socket.recv(1) or socket.recv(1024) and the program's behavior doesn't change.</p>\n<p>In situations like this, where the buffsize has no role in the overall execution of the underlying application, what is a good way to choose this value? What are some important things to consider when making this decision?</p>\n"

Do you use your entities to recreate the database (Hibernate db schema generation) or do you use database versioning like Liquibase or Flyway to run your migrations and recreate your production db?</p>\n"

        "title": "When converting C code structure to python, what is the best data type(s) to use?",
        "body": "<p>In 2019, I wrote a console application for Windows in C that allows the user to specify two elements from the periodic chart and responds with all possible combinations of the two elements.  Since then, I have translated it into C++, C#, Java, and Delphi.  Once I learn a new language, I convert Elements to ensure that the new language ‘sticks’ in my brain.</p>\n<p>Now I want to convert Elements to Python.  My grandson is learning Python and I would like to share the code with him, but I want to ensure that I make good use of the features that are unique to Python.</p>\n<p>Here’s the first few lines of the periodic table data from my c++ version:</p>\n<pre><code>/*--- Instantiate 118 objects, one for each element ---*/\nElements AllElements[TOTAL_ELEMENTS] =\n{\n    Elements(  1, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;Hydrogen&quot;, 1.00794, &quot;-1, 1&quot;),\n    Elements(  2, &quot;He&quot;, &quot;Helium&quot;, 4.002602, &quot;0&quot;),\n    Elements(  3, &quot;Li&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, 6.941, &quot;1&quot;),\n    Elements(  4, &quot;Be&quot;, &quot;Beryllium&quot;, 9.012182, &quot;2&quot;),\n    Elements(  5, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;Boron&quot;, 10.811, &quot;3&quot;),\n    Elements(  6, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;Carbon&quot;, 12.0107, &quot;-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4&quot;),\n</code></pre>\n<p>The values are atomic number, element symbol, element name, atomic weight, and the oxidation states possible for this element enclosed in a string.  Elements was an array of structures in the original C code.</p>\n<p>I could implement Elements as separate, parallel lists, which is appealing if I can implement oxidation state as a list of lists.  Or I could use one of Python’s other data types, or create a class as I did with C++.</p>\n<p>Do any Python developers out there have recommendations?  I know there is always more than one way to do any type of programming, but what would you recommend as “best practices”?  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>\n<p>I considered pairing the element name and element symbol as dictionaries, but wasn’t sure if that was a sensible use of that data type.</p>\n"

I'm implementing an API in the Hexagonal Architecture model, for that I have a RepositoryManager interface for each of my domains. One of the domains is Vehicles, and for now looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>type VehicleRepositoryManager interface {\n    Save(vehicle domain.Vehicle) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    FindById(id string) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    FindByPlate(plate string) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    Update(vehicle domain.Vehicle) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    Delete(id string) error\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Effective Go says interfaces should be small, one or two methods. But for my current situation, I need this interface to have all methods my ServiceLayer to use when implementing the business logic as I will inject the repository struct into the service struct as a interface:</p>\n<pre><code>type VehicleServiceManager interface {\n    Create(vehicle domain.Vehicle) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    GetById(id string) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    GetByPlate(plate string) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    Update(vehicle domain.Vehicle) (domain.Vehicle, error)\n    Delete(id string) error\n}\n\ntype vehicleService struct {\n    repo ports.VehicleRepositoryManager\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then inject my service struct in the controller layer, which is not yet implemented.</p>\n<p>So I have now two interfaces with all the crud methods as the signature, this is super helpful when writing unit tests, because I can implement a fake repository in memory to do so, it just needs to implement the VehicleRepositoryManager interface.</p>\n<p>The question is, is this Idiomatic, or there is a better way of composing interfaces to achieve the same result?</p>\n<p>I am not having technical issues, its just a matter of writing idiomatic go code and using the interfaces in an appropriate way in the context of hexagonal architecture.</p>\n"

The example 'Users' table has fields such as AccountID, Username, Password, Firstname, Lastname, Email, Text, Setting1, Setting2, and Setting3.</p>\n<p>In the services layer of my application, I have implemented getters and setters for Email, Text, Setting1, Setting2, and Setting3. Additionally, there are getters for Firstname and Lastname (but no setters).</p>\n<p>The challenge I am facing is how to efficiently retrieve data from the database when the server code calling these services requires selective fields to perform various operations, while maintaining seperation of the business/services logic from the SQL statements (which exist in data gateway classes).

For example, first query for Firstname, then Setting1, and finally Setting2.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Retrieve All Fields:</strong>\nQuery all fields and retrieve the necessary data, ignoring the unused fields based on the requirements of the client code.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am seeking guidance on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Best Practices:</strong> How is this problem typically solved in the design of RESTful APIs?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong> What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method (sequential queries vs. retrieving all fields)?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Alternative Solutions:</strong> Are there alternative approaches or best practices for efficiently handling selective data retrieval in a scenario like this?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a code example, the services/business logic functions look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>  getUserEmail(userId: number): string {\n    // Implement logic to retrieve user email using the database gateway\n  }\n\n  setUserEmail(userId: number, email: string): void {\n    // Implement logic to update user email using the database gateway\n  }\n\n  // Implement similar functions for other fields\n\n  loginUser(username: string, password: string): boolean {\n    // Implement logic to check if the provided username and password match a user, using the database gateway\n  }\n\n  getUserFirstname(userId: number): string {\n    // Implement logic to retrieve user's firstname using the database gateway\n  }\n\n  getUserLastname(userId: number): string {\n    // Implement logic to retrieve user's lastname using the database gateway\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The database gateway class looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>interface UserTableGateway {\n  // CRUD Operations\n  createUser(user: User): void;\n  readUser(userId: number): User | null;\n  updateUser(user: User): void;\n  deleteUser(userId: number): void;\n\n  // Additional Query Operations\n  getUserByEmail(email: string): User | null;\n  getUserByUsername(username: string): User | null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I appreciate any insights, experiences, or recommendations that you can provide.

However, would it be &quot;slower&quot; because recursion creates a new stack for each recursive call? For example, if we have arr_sum() function, when called, both recursive type and loop type will change the value of global variable sum, but loop are using the main stack but recursive would have to create arr.length() stacks just to complete the same job. I can't see a good reason why we would want to use recursive over normal loop.</p>\n<p>P.S: sorry if my question isn't clear, still new to computer science and also not a English speaker. please be kind :(</p>\n<p>understanding the pros and cons of recursive and loop</p>\n"

Right now i have these options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Auth service sets a jsession cookie by default. So it is stateful. I haven't found a way to make it fully stateless as it needs to save the code from oauth2. I will extract jwt token from it and set it as another cookie. Then i will set my other 2 services as stateless and call them using Bearer token. That works. I found this to be slower, as on every call my services will verify the token with keycloak. I also won't be able to make calls to auth service using Bearer token as it expects cookie-based session.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I share my session via redis for every service that i need to. That way i can access all of my services (on same domain) without any need for setting my headers. I can also make internal calls to other services using that same cookie sent from client. And i found it to be much faster. However im not aware of consequences that may lead to.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Make other services stateless, dont use security in them, route all my requests through gateway, gateway will convert my session cookie into jwt internally, services will simply decode jwt's as they are always signed by keycloak already since its routed through gateway.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was wondering what is a common scenario for you guys? Is it a common practice to share sessions? And what scenario is preferable?</p>\n"

These product IDs are then utilized on the server to retrieve product data from Stripe, enabling a response to the client with all the pertinent information.</p>\n<p>Is this approach considered overkill or standard? What improvements could be contemplated? Should I consider storing all product data in Firestore to circumvent the additional request? Is caching a viable consideration?</p>\n<p>I've tried the structure above, and it seems like the extra request to Stripe could be prevented by either storing all data in the user's cart in Firestore or storing all the product data in a separate collection and referring to that in the user's cart.</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>I am in the process of designing a large system and I'm seeking advice on best practices for its architecture. The system is a payment service provider where we deal with individuals, merchants, partners and the system itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Individuals:</strong> like Paypal where you can raise invoices and get paid with multiple currencies. Individual can pay utilities, manage his wallet and send money to other individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Merchants:</strong> something like Shopify where they can manage their stores, we use tenancy with multiple databases. The merchant can raise invoice, send payment link, create product, offer.. etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Partners:</strong> they can collect cash for merchants or deliver orders to customers.</p>\n<p><strong>System:</strong> the system itself where we manage the approval requests of individuals and merchants and all the system stuff.</p>\n<p>When we started the project we were dealing with only one database since we had a very basic flow and we weren't focusing on a fully functional stores. So multi tenancy would be efficient for merchants. The app is a monolithic, and now we are considering separating the app into small modules Individuals, Merchants, Partners, System, Notifications.. etc. We might have more but these are the modules we current have.</p>\n<p>Merchants can have Apps where they can consume our API and set redirect URL and be notified when a specific event happens with their merchant account like an invoice is paid, a new order is created.. etc. We have another micrcoservice which handles sending webhook events to merchants.</p>\n<p>We also have a microservice to receive webhook events from the payment service providers.</p>\n<h1>Database architecture</h1>\n<p>we are considering separating the database into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>System database: where individuals basic info are stored, partners basic info, merchants basic info plus their store domains for tenancy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tenant database per merchant: every merchant will have their own database where products, invoices, orders, offers, employees, roles, permissions.. etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Partners database: one database to save all partners data.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Individuals database: one database to save all individuals data.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Notifications database: where we save the notifications for individuals, partners employees, system employees and merchant employees.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Payments database: where we are checkout details and online payment transactions for individuals, merchants and the system itself.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is this database segmentation optimal for scalability and data isolation in a multi-tenant environment for merchants?</p>\n<h1>Frontend Structure</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A dashboard for the partners, where they can collect cash and receive notifications regarding the new orders to deliver.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A dashboard for the system employees where we can manage everything.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A dashboard for individuals where they can manage their account and send invoices. Individuals can create merchant account and handle their stores, we have one dashboard for both individuals and merchants and every individual can be an employee in multiple merchant accounts with the same account.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A small project for checkouts and process collecting payments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>API Design</h1>\n<p>We are considering having one project for the API splitted into different modules like mentioned previously, with</p>\n<pre><code>api-individual.example.com // For individuals\napi.example.com // For merchants\napi-partner.example.com // For partners\napi-system.example.com // For the system\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are going to use load balances, RDS's, Redis, Elastic-Search, Queues, S3 buckets.. and many more.</p>\n<h1>Compliance considerations</h1>\n<p>Since the payment industry is very regulated we need to keep this in mind, for the card holder details we need to save those data on soil in the country we are operating in. So, we are currently operating in Egypt and we going to expand in the gulf countries along with some Europe countries and this requires to save customer sensitive data on servers in the countries of those customers. To overcome that issue we will have a separate microservice that has it's own codebase and database hosted on the regulated country.</p>\n<h1>Our stack</h1>\n<p>PHP, Laravel, JS, NodeJs, MySql, Redis</p>\n<p>How can we best architect our system to comply with regional data storage regulations, particularly regarding sensitive customer information?</p>\n<p>How can we improve it's architecture and ensure it's scalable and easy for development. I appreciate any insights or references to similar projects or architecture patterns that could guide the development of this system.</p>\n"

A Mesh is a collection of vertices with indices that move over each face.</p>\n<p>The specific obj file I have been able to render is a simple map I created in blender.</p>\n<h1>Bullet Physics</h1>\n<p>I know the basics of bullet physics when it comes to creating a basic <a href=\"https://pybullet.org/Bullet/BulletFull/classbtDiscreteDynamicsWorld.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>btDiscreteDynamicsWorld</code></a> and then stepping the simulation in a loop.</p>\n<p>Now I want to integrate bullet physics into my game. The part I'm struggling a bit with comes from how to load in arbitrary mesh's into bullet and rendering that.</p>\n<p>So far I know about <a href=\"https://pybullet.org/Bullet/BulletFull/classbtBvhTriangleMeshShape.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>btBvhTriangleMeshShape</code></a>, which I've found recommended on the forum where it was mentioned that this class would be good for representing an arbitrary static mesh such as a map.</p>\n<p>I know that I'll need some way to take my obj file and then to construct this object from it. So far I've seen a procedural creation of a <code>btBvHTriangleMeshShape</code> through <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43090475/6660685\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/43090475/6660685</a>. But <strong>I'm curious to know if there's a way to take advantage of the model loading I've already done with assimp.</strong></p>\n<p>I'm also new to the way things are rendered once I have a physics simulation, <strong>I'm assuming each object will have it's own transform matrix which I can use to move the object's vertices to the correct location in space using the transform matrix in the vertex shader.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Is it best practice to use vertices stored in the <code>btBvhTriangleMeshShape</code> rather then the ones I directly loaded in through whatever method I use to load the obj file when applying the transform matrix?</strong>. I'm assuming there is no difference (unless bullet has uses a different scaling or something)</p>\n<p><strong>I'm also wondering if the general rendering strategy is to iterate through everything in my bullet simulation, and then render it through opengl. Is there any time when we would render things outside of the simulation in the 3D world?</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>\n"

I am a domain expert on marketing but not software architecture, familiar with product dev principles and methodologies but looking for advice on the tools architecture. To create a minimal viable product I was either going to spec a rules based algorithm and have it coded up along with the front and back end .......or craft a tool that sits on top of chatgpt and gathers the information from the user through point and click interface that drives you through a series of questions and crafts the prompt, taking the generated output the user is then give a set of options they click through to provide and solve the problem. The user interface would abstract the complexity associated with interacting with chatgpt and iterating. AI is more attractive as I can add to knowledge base by entering best practice and methodologies and also retain the data to further enhance output. Where if you develop your own algorithm you have the high cost of developing ,  continual refinement and all the compute back end to run it as you scale.  If you were starting from scratch in 2023, what would you do</p>\n<p>I created a custom gpt to prove the concept and it worked fine if you craft the prompts well</p>\n"

For this reason, I'd used several libraries to make it modular, so if I wanted to make other versions or other projects using this libraries, it would be easy.\nThe next image is the hierarchical scheme of all the libraries:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WoiCU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WoiCU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, it has all the .h files of every library, connected by 2 types of arrows, blacks or dotted reds. Black arrow means that the origin .h file uses the destination .h library functions in a direct way. A red dotted line means that the origin .h file doesn't use the destination .h library functions, but it uses at least a data type created on it.</p>\n<p>So here comes my question. Is it correct to include .h files in other .h files in this way? For example, as you can see in the image, fm_lcd_flowmeter.h includes fmc.h, fm_lcd.h, fm_temp_stm32.h, fm_keypad.h, fm_calendar.h and fm_version.h (so fm_lcd_flowmeter.c includes only fm_lcd_flowmeter.h and no other libaries). Or is it more correct to include the .h files in the .c file that uses them?</p>\n<p>In many cases, I've designed the libraries so the .h files define functions that can use data types defined in low level .h files, but is this an standard way to program in c using libraries? or at least is it correct?</p>\n<p>I've several doubts about it after talking with some people about this C coding habit, who told me that it is not an standard way, it's not correct and it's not reusable, so I will be very grateful to hear some new opinions about this.</p>\n"

The user will enter 0/0/0 to indicate that no more dates will be entered.\nAn example of the program output is also given by the book where the user input is highlighted in italic.</p>\n<p>Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): <em>3/6/08</em></p>\n<p>Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): <em>5/17/07</em></p>\n<p>Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): <em>6/3/07</em></p>\n<p>Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): <em>0/0/0</em></p>\n<p>5/17/07 is the earliest date.</p>\n<p>Below is my initial attempt which seems to produce the desired output:</p>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n// Below is a program that accepts any number of user-entered dates and returns the earliest date\n\n// The program keeps track of a running variable for earliest month, day and year, against which each entry is compared\n\nint main(void)\n{\n\n    int month, day, year;\n    int earliest_month, earliest_day, earliest_year;\n\n    // Initialisation\n\n    earliest_month = 0;\n    earliest_day = 0;\n    earliest_year = 0;\n\n    do\n    {\n        printf(&quot;Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): &quot;);\n        scanf(&quot;%d/%d/%d&quot;, &amp;month, &amp;day, &amp;year);\n\n        if (earliest_month == 0 &amp;&amp; earliest_day == 0 &amp;&amp; earliest_year == 0)\n        {\n            earliest_month = month;\n            earliest_day = day;\n            earliest_year = year;\n        }\n\n        // First compare the years\n        if (year != 0 &amp;&amp; year &lt; earliest_year)\n        {\n            earliest_month = month;\n            earliest_day = day;\n            earliest_year = year;\n        }\n        else if (year == earliest_year)\n        {\n            // If years are equal, compare months\n            if (month != 0 &amp;&amp; month &lt; earliest_month)\n            {\n                earliest_month = month;\n                earliest_day = day;\n            }\n            else if (month == earliest_month)\n            {\n                // If years and months are the equal, compare days\n                if (day != 0 &amp;&amp; day &lt; earliest_day)\n                {\n                    earliest_day = day;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n    } while (month != 0 || day != 0);\n\n    printf(&quot;%d/%d/%.2d is the earliest date&quot;, earliest_month, earliest_day, earliest_year);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>I now wish to get some feedback on this code and if possible, some recommendation on how to improve it. I already notice a double initialisation in my code precisely for the earliest month, day and year day variables (one outside the do and a second one inside the do statement). My idea was to have the earliest variables initially set to the first user output, but I still had to initialise them to 0 first (not sure whether that is required either but I also don't know how to make the program assign the first user input to these values).</p>\n<p>Any feedback at all would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46492946/i-am-writing-a-program-which-outputs-the-earliest-date-the-user-enter-but-some-p\">Related issue</a></p>\n"

        "closed_reason": "Opinion-based",
        "title": "golang: pattern for handling message queues? Are functions anti-idiomatic?",
        "body": "<p>Me and my boss had a discussion today in how to implement services that works with messages coming in from event queues. We call these services processors. One of us argues for using several functions, while the other argues for fewer functions that do more things, according to idiomatic go. To make things more difficult, there's a healthy amount of async stuff happening and I'm new to async.</p>\n<p>In essence, what the code must do is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>set up the project: config, logging and start the service up.</li>\n<li>listening to message queues, potentially respond. Every time a message pops in, we may start to spin up a new goroutine.</li>\n<li>process some of the data inside the message, potentially return it to the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I cannot just copy the code for legal reasons but will make pseudo code.\nOne approach consists of making two functions, main() and do().</p>\n<p>main sets up config, logger, and service.\ndo listens to message queue. Because of NATS library, the code that handles the message is a callback function. It looks something like this:</p>\n<p><code>sub, err := nats.Subscribe(topic, cbFunction)</code></p>\n<p>This approach insists in making an anonymous function that peels the message for the field that we want to process, processes it if it's synchronous, and responds to the queue with a new message with a field containing this processed data.</p>\n<pre><code># inside do()\n\nsub, err := nc.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n  // logs\n  // checks data consistency\n  // processes data\n  // creates response with processed data inside\n  // responds to queue with processed data\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it's async, then uses a channel to send data, and the part that processes it stays in it's own goroutine, listening to the channel.</p>\n<pre><code># inside do()\n\ngo func() {\n  for {\n    select {\n      // listens to channel and processes sent in data\n      // handles errors if any\n      // responds to queue\n    }\n  }\n}()\n\nsub, err := nc.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n  // logs\n  // checks data consistency\n  // sends data to channel\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is another completely different approach, which is using newly created functions handleMessage(msg *nats.Msg) and process(data).</p>\n<pre><code># outside do()\n\nfunc handleMessage(msg *nats.Msg) {\n  // logs\n  // checks data consistency\n  processedData, err := process(data)\n  // creates response with processed data inside\n  // responds to queue with processed data\n}\n\nfunc process(data) (processedData, error) {\n  // processes data\n  // returns processedData\n}\n\n\n# inside do()\nsub, err := nc.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n  handleMessage(msg)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>if needs to be async, then process is invoked in do() and handleMessage doesn't call process directly, but rather uses channel. In turn, we have a second channel for returning data and potentially a third one for error. So:</p>\n<pre><code># outside do()\n\nfunc handleMessage(ctx, chIn, chOut, chErr, msg) {\n  // logs\n  // checks data consistency\n  processedData, err := process(data)\n  // handles errors or creates response with processed data inside\n  // responds to queue with processed data\n}\n\nfunc process(ctx, chIn, chOut, chErr) (processedData, error) {\n  // processes data\n  // returns processedData\n}\n\n\n# inside do()\nchIn := make(chan []byte)\nchOut := make(chan []byte)\nchErr := make(chan error)\n\ngo process(ctx, chIn, chOut, chErr)\n\nsub, err := nc.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n  go handleMessage(ctx, chIn, chOut, chErr, msg)\n})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Right off the bat, which one is the best approach? Are there better ways of doing this?</p>\n<p>Another big consideration: some of these processors are going to be an example for customers, who are also programmers. We're going to have examples in different programming languages. One side argue for all examples having the same structure. The other one for being idiomatic to each language. As a go dev, which example would you prefer and is clearer to grasp?</p>\n<p>Other considerations that both side argue in their favour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>named functions: more simple, more testable, more reusable - processors would mostly differ in how they process the data.</li>\n<li>anon functions: more simple, named function has too many channels, idiomatic go - fine for something like Python, but not go.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I expected to put up a case but he put a different one. Both have their merits and weaknesses, I guess. Which one would you prefer as go devs? Are we missing something? Should we be idiomatic or agnostic? Are three channels that much of a problem?</p>\n"

What I am missing?</p>\n<p>The difference between final LUT calculated using 256 vs 257 linspace is up to 1.5% in my case, so it may not be visible, but I am curious what is the right way to do that.</p>\n"

In Spring, this becomes a simple getter in a controller, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@RestController\n@RequestMapping(&quot;/citizenRequests&quot;)\npublic class CitizenRequestController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private CitizenRequestService citizenRequestService;\n\n    @GetMapping\n    public List&lt;CitizenRequest&gt; getAllCitizenRequests() {\n        return citizenRequestService.getAllCitizenRequests();\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>My question is: the query i did at the beginning on the collection, using mongo, was pretty brief and (as i know) was better on the performance side.</p>\n<p>If i want to convert that query in java, i should cycle through the list and saving the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude. Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public void generateZonesFromLatLong() {\n\n        List&lt;CitizenRequest&gt; citizenRequests = citizenRequestController.getAllCitizenRequests();\n\n        double leftLon = 0;\n        double topLat = 0;\n        double rightLon = 0;\n        double bottomLat = 0;\n\n        for (CitizenRequest citizenRequest : citizenRequests) {\n            double lat = citizenRequest.getStarterPoint().getLatitude();\n            double lon = citizenRequest.getStarterPoint().getLongitude();\n\n            if (lat &lt; bottomLat){\n                bottomLat = lat;\n            }\n            if (lat &gt; topLat){\n                topLat = lat;\n            }\n            if (lon &lt; leftLon){\n                leftLon = lon;\n            }\n            if (lon &gt; rightLon){\n                rightLon = lon;\n            }\n        };\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, my question is: what's better? Cycle throught it using a for cycle, or is there a better way to use directly the mongodb's queries?</p>\n"

Thus I am keen to avoid any &quot;leaky&quot; implementation where the applications start depending directly on one or more interceptor.</p>\n<p>I would like to understand the best practices for such a situation:</p>\n<p>a) should I declare the interceptor with multi-provider in each library's <code>NgModule</code>, and then import those library modules using <code>importProvidersFrom</code> in the main application <a href=\"https://github.com/MurhafSousli/ngx-progressbar/blob/master/projects/ngx-progressbar/http/src/ng-progress-http.module.ts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as per this example</a></p>\n<pre><code>@NgModule({\n  providers: [\n    { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: NgProgressInterceptor, multi: true }\n  ]\n})\nexport class NgProgressHttpModule {\n  static withConfig(config: NgProgressHttpConfig): ModuleWithProviders&lt;NgProgressHttpModule&gt; {\n    return {\n      ngModule: NgProgressHttpModule,\n      providers: [\n        { provide: NG_PROGRESS_HTTP_CONFIG, useValue: config }\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n}\n\n\n---\n\nin the application:\n\nbootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {\n  providers: [\n    importProvidersFrom(BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, NgProgressHttpModule, NgProgressRouterModule),\n    provideAnimations(),\n    provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi())\n  ]\n}).catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\n</code></pre>\n<p>p.s. Seems like this was the option provided for standalone components, and for those, <a href=\"https://blog.ninja-squad.com/2022/11/09/angular-http-in-standalone-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the new recommendation is <code>provideHttpClient</code></a>\nor</p>\n<p>b) Should I provide a forRoot implementation in each library's NgModule and declare the interceptors as providers in the <code>forRoot</code> method? <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57699081\">(e.g.)</a> or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67665013/angular-httpinterceptor-declared-in-library-module-intercepting-requests-outsid\">another example</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/39665993\">As per this explanation</a>, it seems like using <code>forRoot</code> is the recommendation for providers which should be instantiated only once per application (i.e. Singletons); this is echoed <a href=\"https://medium.com/slackernoon/when-to-use-angulars-forroot-method-400094a0ebb7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well.</p>\n<pre><code>@NgModule({\n    imports: [ConcreteAuthModule]\n})\nexport class AuthenticationModule {\n    static forRoot(config: AuthConfig): ModuleWithProviders {\n        return {\n            ngModule: AuthenticationModule,\n            providers: [\n                {\n                    provide: AUTH_CONFIG,\n                    useValue: config\n                }, {\n                    provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,\n                    useClass: BearerInterceptor,\n                    multi: true\n                }\n            ]\n        };\n    }\n}\n\n--- \n\nin the App Modules:\n\nimports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n    AuthenticationModule.forRoot({ /* config stuff */ })\n  ],\n</code></pre>\n<p><em><strong>However</strong></em>, I do not see this pattern followed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/060ea83198dbb9afc6a7ba78b70d06d9f4eb9b16/packages/common/http/src/module.ts#L29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Angular source code</a> for HttpClientXsrfModule so I'm confused.</p>\n<p>c) A good tip in  <a href=\"https://vikky.dev/the-mysterious-bug-when-consuming-an-angular-library-with-interceptor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this blog post</a> clarifies that <a href=\"https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor#usage-notes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as per the Angular guide</a> it is best to import the HttpClientModule only in the AppModule for each app, and shouldn't be imported in the libraries; Are there any other such best practices to be followed?</p>\n"

Here's a snippet of our code:</p>\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Load data (example data: features and labels)\n# Features represent various metrics of our CI/CD pipeline\n# Labels are 0 (Build successful) or 1 (Build failed)\nfeatures, labels = load_pipeline_data() \n\n# Splitting the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Using RandomForestClassifier for prediction\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Prediction and accuracy\npredictions = clf.predict(X_test)\nprint(f&quot;Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)}&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, we're facing some challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which metrics from our CI/CD processes are most indicative for predicting build failures?</li>\n<li>How can we further refine our model to increase the accuracy of predictions?</li>\n<li>Are there established best practices or frameworks specifically designed for this type of application in DevOps?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any help or insight into these topics would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"

I have not used it as a runtime yet, but I did do some research about its JS-rendering engine, JavaScriptCore. It seems that it is primarily used in Apple operating systems. From what I have read, it is also more scalable than its rivals, NodeJS and DenoJS, and can handle many more requests per second. Additively, I also read that it is compatible with NodeJS libraries. But, although compatible with NodeJS libraries, will its use of the JavaScriptCore engine make it harder for big companies that already use NodeJS like Uber to implement it in their backend and server-side systems, or will this result in the mere opposite?</p>\n<p>I have seen other StackOverflow questions stating errors based on their operating system like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77102635/bun-latest-version-is-not-getting-installed-in-my-windows\">this</a> one.</p>\n<p>I have also tried to use Bun on my older computers, and somehow it will not install packages with <code>bun i PACKAGE_NAME</code> or <code>bun install PACKAGE_NAME</code>, somehow related to my operating system drivers.</p>\n<p>Does anybody know if this will impact its use in the future, or will it just get more mature over time?</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>As far as I can see in golang sources there are no examples with error constructors except <code>errors</code> package itself. Basically, authors return a type that was constructed manually.</p>\n<p>For example, we have <code>net</code> package with <code>OpError</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/blob/5b6d3dea8744311825fd544a73edb8d26d9c7e98/src/net/net.go#L440C22-L440C22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">custom error</a> struct</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-golang prettyprint-override\"><code>type OpError struct {\n    // Op is the operation which caused the error, such as\n    // &quot;read&quot; or &quot;write&quot;.\n    Op string\n\n    ...\n}\n\nfunc (e *OpError) Error() string {\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and they use them by direct declaration, without any constructors</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-golang prettyprint-override\"><code>func (c *conn) SetDeadline(t time.Time) error {\n    if !c.ok() {\n        return syscall.EINVAL\n    }\n    if err := c.fd.SetDeadline(t); err != nil {\n        return &amp;OpError{Op: &quot;set&quot;, Net: c.fd.net, Source: nil, Addr: c.fd.laddr, Err: err}\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc (c *conn) File() (f *os.File, err error) {\n    f, err = c.fd.dup()\n    if err != nil {\n        err = &amp;OpError{Op: &quot;file&quot;, Net: c.fd.net, Source: c.fd.laddr, Addr: c.fd.raddr, Err: err}\n    }\n    return\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I wonder, what is idiomatic way to write custom error constructor in terms of what the type I should return? Should I return built-in interface error or instance of my custom type?</p>\n<p>Perhaps there is our custom domain error type with some domain code and abstract details</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-golang prettyprint-override\"><code>type DomainErrorCode int\n\ntype DomainError struct {\n    err error\n    Code DomainErrorCode\n    Details []byte\n}\n\nfunc (e *DomainError) Error() string {\n    return e.err.Error()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Constructor can be</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-golang prettyprint-override\"><code>// A\nfunc NewDomainError(err error, code DomainErrorCode, details Details) error {\n    return &amp;DomainError{err: err, Code: code, Details: details}\n}\n\n// B\nfunc NewDomainError(err error, code DomainErrorCode, details Details) *DomainError {\n    return &amp;DomainError{err: err, Code: code, Details: details}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Option <code>B</code> is flexible and allows you to construct custom error and reach attributes like <code>Code</code> or <code>Details</code>.\nOption <code>A</code> is more encapsulated and if you need access to custom attributes you need some kind of assertation.</p>\n<p>Then I see <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#generality\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">official guidelines of Generality</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a type exists only to implement an interface and will never have exported methods beyond that interface, there is no need to export the type itself. Exporting just the interface makes it clear the value has no interesting behavior beyond what is described in the interface. It also avoids the need to repeat the documentation on every instance of a common method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what is idiomatic way to write the constructor in this example? Seems like option <code>A</code>, because I don't have any methods besides built-in <code>interface error</code>. But this limits access to important custom attributes and will cost extra effort for type assertation if fields are needed. For me option <code>B</code> seems more reasonable</p>\n"

Should I consider changing it to a GET method instead?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Handling tokens in the URL: The token required for authentication is passed as part of the request body (req.body.token). If I change the method to GET I'm concerned about security by having tokens in the URL. What would be a more secure approach? Is it better to pass tokens via headers or any other recommended method?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Combination of URL parameters and body data: Currently, I'm using a combination of URL parameters (serviceId), query parameters (target) and the token from the request body. Is this approach acceptable, or should I modify it to maintain a more consistent approach?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I tried a couple of approaches, they all work as intended but my concerns are about best practices.</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>I'm looking to implement a functionality that handles a change of input i.e. a button clicked in a GUI, or in my case, a signal received by an udp-socket. I want the event to be handled in a way, that an object <code>Foo fooReceived</code>, received in class <code>Receiver</code>, is passed to a member function <code>handlerFunc(Foo fooReceived)</code> of another class <code>Handler</code>.</p>\n<p>So far I came up with two approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Using signal-slot procedure: Whenever an event occurs, a signal is emitted, which evokes the slot <code>handlerFunc(Foo fooReceived)</code>, which is a public member function of <code>Receiver</code>. I used this approach while developing <code>GTKMM</code> GUIs. A basic example of the library <code>sigc++</code> can be found <a href=\"https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/Using_libsigc%2B%2B_signals\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using a callback procedure with function objects:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>#include &lt;functional&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nstruct Foo {\n    int data;\n};\n\n// Handler class with a member function to handle the received data\nclass Handler {\npublic:\n    void handlerFunc(const Foo&amp; fooReceived) {\n        //handle fooReceived\n    }\n};\n\n// Receiver class with a callback mechanism\nclass Receiver {\npublic:\n    // Define a callback type using std::function\n    using CallbackType = std::function&lt;void(const Foo&amp;)&gt;;\n\n    // Set the callback function\n    void setCallback(const CallbackType&amp; callback) {\n        callback_ = callback;\n    }\n\n    // Simulate receiving data and trigger the callback\n    void receiveData(const Foo&amp; foo) {\n        if (callback_) {\n            callback_(foo);\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    // Callback function to be triggered when data is received\n    CallbackType callback_;\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Handler handler;\n    Receiver receiver;\n\n    // Set the callback function in the Receiver\n    receiver.setCallback(std::bind(&amp;Handler::handlerFunc, &amp;handler, std::placeholders::_1));\n\n    // Simulate receiving data in the Receiver\n    Foo receivedFoo{42};\n    receiver.receiveData(receivedFoo);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that within the second approach, its necessairy to have a <code>Handler</code> instance, so the callback can be set. Consiquently I would have to set a member instance of <code>Handler</code> in the <code>Receiver</code> class which is not the case in the signal slot approach.</p>\n<p>Since I'm looking to handle the data by plotting them in a GUI (ImGui) that is not Gtk, I feel like <code>sigc++</code> should not be used.\nWill setting a member instance of <code>Handler</code>cause any problems? What are potential risks with this approach?</p>\n"

But if I want to use the vertex shader, I have to create a whole new vertex shader that uses the same code as before with the only difference being that it now outputs the vec4 that Paint Shader will use, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>#version 330 core\n\nlayout (location = 0) in vec4 values;\nlayout (location = 1) in vec4 rect;\nlayout (location = 2) in int depth;\nlayout (location = 3) in float radians;\nlayout (location = 4) in float effect;\nlayout (location = 5) in vec4 tint_;\n\nlayout (std140) uniform Matrices\n{\n    mat4 projection;\n    mat4 view;\n};\n\n\nout vec2 texCoord;\nout vec4 tint;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    vec2 transformed = vec2(values.xy * rect.zw*.5); //scale\n    transformed = vec2(cos(radians)*transformed.x - sin(radians)*transformed.y,sin(radians)*transformed.x + cos(radians)*transformed.y); //rotate\n    transformed += rect.xy + rect.zw*.5; //move\n    gl_Position = projection*view*vec4(transformed,depth,1);\n    texCoord = vec2(values.z,values.a);\n    tint = tint_;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I have two vertex shaders that do effectively the same thing but because of the fragment shader they differ by 3 lines. If I ever decide to change how my vertex shaders work, I now have to change both of them rather than just one.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to do this without creating a 2nd vertex shader? Could I use this 2nd iteration of a vertex shader with the original fragment shader but just ignore the &quot;tint&quot; output?</p>\n"

Here are some of the options:</p>\n<h2>Option 1.</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private static Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClassesFromPackage(String packageName) {\n        Reflections reflections = new Reflections(packageName, new SubTypesScanner(false));\n        return new HashSet&lt;&gt;(reflections.getSubTypesOf(Object.class));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not optimal: <code>SubTypesScanner</code> is deprecated so you'll get a warning</p>\n<h2>Option 2.</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private static Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClassesFromPackage(String packageName) {\n        Reflections reflections = new Reflections(packageName, Scanners.SubTypes.filterResultsBy(s -&gt; true));\n        return new HashSet&lt;&gt;(reflections.getSubTypesOf(Object.class));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Not optimal: <code>Scanners.SubTypes.filterResultsBy(s -&gt; true)</code> is clumsy AF so you either get code that is not easily readable or you have to provide some meta commentary</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private static Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClassesFromPackage(String packageName) {\n        Reflections reflections = new Reflections(packageName, getStuffThatMakesItWork());\n        return new HashSet&lt;&gt;(reflections.getSubTypesOf(Object.class));\n    }\n\n    private static Scanners getStuffThatMakesItWork() {\n        return Scanners.SubTypes.filterResultsBy(s -&gt; true);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wouldn't it be peachy if I could write just this</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private static Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClassesFromPackage(String packageName) {\n        Reflections reflections = new Reflections(packageName);\n        return new HashSet&lt;&gt;(reflections.getSubTypesOf(Object.class));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is so much more readable, but sadly it doesn't work (the returned set would contain zero items)</p>\n<p>What is the best way to scan for package classes?</p>\n<p>Criteria:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The code should be as short as possible.</li>\n<li>The code should be readable (a random person shouldn't get any WTF moments when looking at it)</li>\n<li>You shouldn't get warnings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your solution should essentially implement this interface (you may not do it explicitly in your answer):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public interface PackageScanner {\n    Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClassesFromPackage(String packageName);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that the whole <code>Reflections</code> library is <a href=\"https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not maintained</a> since 2021 so it may not be a solid long-term solution to rely on it. Are there alternatives that are at least just as good?</p>\n<p><strong>UPD:</strong> I tried to implement Reilas's suggestion to use <code>Class.forName()</code>, but it resulted in an extremely awkward code</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// here I reveal that all along I actually wanted to scan for all entities and DTOs\n    private static void scanForEntitiesAndDtos() {\n        File sourceRoot = new File(&quot;&quot;);\n        entitiesAndDtos.addAll(\n                    Arrays.stream(Objects.requireNonNull(sourceRoot.listFiles()))\n                            .map(clazz -&gt; {\n                                try {\n                                    return Class.forName(clazz.getPath());\n                                } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n                                    throw new RuntimeException(e);\n                                }\n                            })\n                            .filter(BasicDataGeneratorTest::isEntityOrDto)\n                            .collect(Collectors.toSet())\n        );\n    }\n\n    private static boolean isEntityOrDto(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) {\n        return isEntity(clazz) || isDto(clazz);\n    }\n\n    private static boolean isEntity(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) {\n        return clazz.getAnnotation(Entity.class) != null;\n    }\n\n    private static boolean isDto(Class&lt;?&gt; clazz) {\n        return clazz.getSimpleName().endsWith(&quot;Dto&quot;);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Besides, it doesn't work, I get NPEs when it comes to <code>Objects.requireNotNull()</code>. Things I tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>new File(&quot;&quot;)</code></li>\n<li><code>new File(&quot;com.example.projectname&quot;)</code></li>\n<li><code>new File(&quot;com/example/projectname&quot;)</code></li>\n<li><code>new File(&quot;src.main.java.com.example.projectname&quot;)</code></li>\n<li><code>new File(&quot;src/main/java/com/example/projectname&quot;)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess it's because <code>listFiles()</code> doesn't scan subdirectories (who knows, the method's doc is silent on this), but if you create <code>File</code>s from strings returned by <code>file.list()</code>, filter them by <code>File::isFile</code>, then convert them into classes using <code>Class.forName(file.getPath())</code>, it becomes even clumsier (assuming it would all work)</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>I'm (relatively) new to TS adoption and very much on board with using it going forward. It definitely seems a great way to augment my existing JS experience. I have a question about type annotations which has been bothering me.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose I have a <code>const</code> which is a string. Not only is it a string, but we know it must be one of a certain set of strings. As I understand it, we would use a union as a type annotation</p>\n<pre><code>type JobTitle = 'Manager' | 'Supervisor' | 'Burger flipper';\nconst myJobTitle: JobTitle = 'Manager'; // Setting as 'Cashier' would cause compiler to shout at me\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n<p>If I take that example to the next stage, what happens if there is only a single permitted value? I quite often export HTTP status codes to use across my applications.</p>\n<pre><code>// httpStatusCodes.ts\n\nexport const UNAUTHORIZED: number = 401;\nexport const FORBIDDEN: number = 403;\nexport const NOT_FOUND: number = 404;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<p>In this scenario, not only do we know these values should be numbers, but we <em>know</em> exactly what numbers they should be. Would it be overkill to replace <code>number</code> with the specific value (e.g. <code>export const NOT_FOUND: 404 = 404;</code>) in this instance?</p>\n<p>On the one hand, this feels a bit redundant, but on the other, I get the impression that TS encourages us to be as specific as possible with these things, as it not only aids development but acts as documentation as well.</p>\n<p>My other thought is that <code>404</code> isn't a type, but rather a <em>value</em>, so it shouldn't be used as an annotation (despite the fact that it makes the code stricter and more explicit)</p>\n<p>Like I said, still pretty new to this TS world, so just trying to get a feel for where the lines are generally drawn on these things.</p>\n"

I guess this means the variable is copied to new location in memory and then passed (which involved allocation, copying, and then passing to function).</p>\n<p>Then we do this:</p>\n<pre><code>static void main()\n{\n    string name = &quot;hello world&quot;;\n    Console.WriteLine(name);\n    testfunc(ref name);\n    Console.WriteLine(name);\n}\n\nvoid testfunc(ref string name)\n{\n    name = &quot;stackoverflow&quot;;\n    Console.WriteLine(name);\n}\n\n#Output\n=&gt; hello world\n=&gt; stackoverflow\n=&gt; stackoverflow\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, in this I guess the original variable reference/pointer was passed into the function and no allocation or copying of new memory/data took place.</p>\n<p>So, I was thinking whether the first method has some overhead (it surely must have for data &gt;= 10MB). But then the second method is unsafe as it can potentially corrupt the original data.</p>\n<p>so, what should we do or what kind of optimization can we put in place to overcome the overhead of the first method (if there is any)? Also same is valid for values returned from the function.</p>\n<p>**My Use Case: ** I am developing a game in unity. I have to generate a world. For that, I create 3D noise maps (very large and also multiple for humidity, civilization, terrain, etc.). They take up total of about 70-80 MBs of memory. Now, I pass them all to a function where they are combined, and the final world is generated. So, if 100 MB of data is copied in memory (like in the first method above) then I don't think it will be very good with machines having &lt;= 4GB of ram.\nAs for the data returned from a function, let's say I have a save file of 25 MB (some games like RimWorld have such large save files). I call the <code>loadSaveFile()</code> function (it reads the file, casts it to <code>SaveClass</code> and stores it in a variable <code>saveData</code>, and returns it). this <code>saveData</code> variable should be about 25-28 MB in size. So, if the data returned is duplicated too, then it is bad for such large data.</p>\n<p>I know the duplicated data will be eventually destroyed by GC but that will stutter the frame rate for that particular frame when GC destroys it. This can be solved by using incremental GC but still the memory inflation (for those few seconds from the duplicated data being created and destroyed will affect the overall performance of machine).</p>\n<p><strong>So, the final question is:</strong> What is the correct, best, and most practical way to pass big data as parameters to a function and also receive big data as returned value?</p>\n"

        "body": "<p>In a lot of languages, you can override the value of a property of a class when extending an abstract class, and the parent methods will read this new variable when used, an example would be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>abstract class A {\n    protected string foo;\n    \n    void PrintFoo() {\n        print(foo);\n    }\n}\n\nclass B extends A {\n    protected string foo = &quot;bar&quot;;\n}\n\n(new B()).PrintFoo(); // outputs: bar\n</code></pre>\n<p>In C# I haven't been able to find a standard way to do this, as this is not allowed.</p>\n<p>One way I've found is by passing it by parent constructor like:</p>\n<pre><code>abstract class A {\n    protected string foo;\n    public A(string foo) {\n        this.foo = foo;\n    }\n\n    void PrintFoo() {\n        Console.WriteLine(foo);\n    }\n}\n\nclass B : A {\n    public B() : A(&quot;bar&quot;) {}\n}\n\n(new B()).PrintFoo(); // outputs: bar\n</code></pre>\n<p>But clearly this is not clean at all.\nAnother way I've seen is by making a virtual string and overriding it later (which would be similar to the other languages):</p>\n<pre><code>abstract class A {\n    protected virtual string Foo { get; }\n\n    void PrintFoo() {\n        Console.WriteLine(Foo);\n    }\n}\n\nclass B : A {\n    protected override string Foo {\n        get { return &quot;bar&quot;; }\n    }\n}\n\n(new B()).PrintFoo(); // outputs: bar\n</code></pre>\n<p>It seems as to me the second way is the appropriate one, but it's not as clean as I expected.</p>\n<p>Is there a better way?</p>\n"

Therefore, I tried VB .NET. I found the transition to be quite easy, and the VB code was far more readable and concise compared to C#/C++. As I had mentioned, I did not want to install anything, so I did not try .NET 6 and 7. I aim to utilize built-in tools like <code>vbc.exe</code> or portable tools as much as possible. However, the problem with .NET framework is that the startup time remains consistently between 1-2 seconds, regardless of the code's weightiness or the language used (VB or C#). In contrast, VB6 applications start immediately. Here's an example that is written in VB .NET:</p>\n<pre><code>Imports System.Windows.Forms\nImports System.Drawing\n\nPublic Class Form1\n    Inherits Form\n\n    Private WithEvents button As New Button()\n    Private WithEvents textBox As New TextBox()\n\n    Public Sub New()\n        button.Text = &quot;Browse&quot;\n        button.Location = New Point(10, 10)\n        Me.Controls.Add(button)\n\n        textBox.Location = New Point(10, 40)\n        Me.Controls.Add(textBox)\n    End Sub\nEnd Class\n\nModule Module1\n    Sub Main()\n        Application.Run(New Form1)\n    End Sub\nEnd Module\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I did:</p>\n<p>1.</p>\n<pre><code>CD C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319 \nNGEN update\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>I tried various options for the <code>vbc.exe</code> (and <code>csc.exe</code>) compilers, such as <code>/optimize[+|-]</code> and <code>/platform</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Different versions of the .NET framework (both 32-bit and 64-bit) including versions 2, 3.5, and 4.x.x.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using <code>msbuild.exe</code> to compile my application with the following command:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>msbuild /property:Configuration=Release;UseDotNetNativeToolchain=true MyFile.vbproj</code>,</p>\n<p>here is content of MyFile.vbproj:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Project xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot; Sdk=&quot;Microsoft.NET.Sdk&quot; &gt;\n  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\n    &lt;OutputType&gt;WinExe&lt;/OutputType&gt;\n    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;\n    &lt;UseDotNetNativeToolchain&gt;true&lt;/UseDotNetNativeToolchain&gt;\n  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\n\n  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n    &lt;Compile Include=&quot;DiCalc.vb&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n\n&lt;Target Name=&quot;Build&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Vbc Sources=&quot;@(Compile)&quot; OutputAssembly=&quot;DiCalc.exe&quot; TargetType=&quot;WinExe&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/Target&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/Project&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I do not have any antivirus software installed on my system.

        "body": "<p>I started looking into WPF and Avalonia to build a ui with a pixelart look. I get that both are built around vector based graphics and probably not best suited towards pixel graphics.</p>\n<p>I was not looking to get an opinion, even if the original question was maybe unclear. The question was: is wpf/avalonia the right tool for it?</p>\n<p>After the answer I got and some more reading/tinkering I could say that it is quite feasible but slightly more complicated.  As mentioned in the answer, for example, if I strip away all the default  styles of a button and slap in a pixel art &quot;facade&quot; I just need to lock the button dimensions. So even if the whole window can resize and controls move (like in modern apps) the controls that use custom pixel &quot;facade&quot; have the dimensions locked and still keeping the wanted look.</p>\n<p>Furthermore I guess it could be possible to use vector graphics but with a pixelart look, meaning graphics with higher resolution &quot;pretending to be pixels&quot; (like a single pixel is drawn using a vector square), but I would need to do some more experimenting.</p>\n<p>I'm sort of answering my own question here, but the answer I got from users made me dig into wpf more, so I post here my humble findings.</p>\n"

A regular client sends data via a regular post request. On the server, the controller (which received this data from the client) sends a message to the admin that &quot;hey, I got the data and you can request it from me.&quot; The admin sends a get request and receives the data.</p>\n<p>That is, completely change the scheme of interaction between all clients and the server, even if the information being sent is one class for 5 properties with a size of 10-20 bytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Which solution is correct or maybe there are others?</strong></p>\n"

Many responses from contain nested serializers, for example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>class TemplateSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n     colors = ColorSerializer(read_only=True, many=True)\n     fonts = FontSerializer(read_only=True, many=True)\n     property_ids = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True, queryset=Property.objects.all())\n...\n     class Meta:\n          model = Template\n          fields = '__all__'\n\nclass ColorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n     swatch = SwatchSerializer(read_only=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n          model = Color\n          fields = '__all__'\n\n# and so forth, just imagine several serializers with fields that are read only or write only etc\n</code></pre>\n<p>Currently I was have all serializers in <code>my_app/serializers.py</code> and the <code>serializers.py</code> file has grown way too large and disorganized. In that file, a django model usually has several versions of serializers, for example, the <code>list</code> view method may have a different serializer than <code>retrieve</code> and <code>create</code> may have a different serializer than <code>update</code>, etc. So a single ViewSet may have 4-5 different serializers. Also, the nested serializers, like the <code>ColorSerializer</code> above, may have different versions based on requirements of the response when its nested in another serializer versus when <code>GET /colors</code> endpoint is called.</p>\n<p>With that being said, I want to start organizing/refactoring things for readability to try to be more DRY. I'm aware the API is poorly designed, but redesigning is not an option due to the amount of time it will take. What is the best way forward to clean up my <code>serializers.py</code> file and Serializer classes? Any help and opinion is appreciated! Thanks</p>\n"

But I really wonder what's the design principle behind this. I don't think <code>u32 - i32</code> is more dangerous than <code>u32 - u32</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>let a: u32 = 10;\nlet b: u32 = 100;\nlet c = a - b;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does compile, but it panics at runtime. So why is Rust so paranoid about operating between different numeric types?

That's why the corporate sector and large IT services companies are in favor of the traditional Java/Springboot + Angular stack. I feel like some of them are still reluctant to use React because they considerer it too simplified and too messy. While startups like React for its lower costs, corporates are not convinced as they are afraid it won't scale.

To do so, we create additional classes for a better migration in the future JHipster release.

There are two approaches to have it. One approach is to have FooExtendedRepository in the FooExtendedService. The other approach is to change the FooRepository attribute to FooExtendedService in the FooService class and remove the @Repository annotation from the FooRepository. The first approach is straightforward with minimum code changes, but that will double the number of instances in the system. Which approach shall we use?</p>\n"

Does it make sense for a ViewModel to be used this way or is it a code smell that should be addressed?</p>\n"

        "title": "Designing an &quot;Events&quot; Table with Multiple Table References in a Data Model",
        "body": "<p>Although the original problem was presented to me as an MSSQL database implementation, what I'm discussing here is a general perspective, not specific details.</p>\n<p>Let's consider that I have three base tables:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Drivers</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>TransportCompanies</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these tables has its own primary key and a set of fields unique to them. For example, the <strong>Drivers</strong> table contains attributes like <code>Name</code>, <code>Address</code>, <code>BirthDate</code>, and more, while the <strong>Vehicles</strong> table includes attributes such as <code>LicensePlate</code>, <code>VehicleType</code>, <code>Brand</code>, <code>Model</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Now, there's a new requirement to implement an <strong>Events</strong> table. The goal is to store all events in a single table (as an arbitrary prerequisite, I suppose), given that the events share many common attributes such as <code>Type</code> (Unavailable, On Hold, Accident, Priority Request), <code>DateTime from/to</code>, <code>Flags</code> to determine if the event has a monetary cost associated with it, the Company <code>personnel</code> responsible for tracking or resolving it, and more.</p>\n<p>I see two primary options for designing this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <strong>Events</strong> table can have three nullable fields that serve as foreign keys pointing to each individual table (i.e., <strong>Drivers</strong>, <strong>Vehicles</strong>, and <strong>TransportCompanies</strong>), along with a separate field (let's call it <code>EventType</code>) that identifies to which of the three related tables a specific Event record applies. Validation can be enforced with a trigger to ensure that one of the three foreign keys has a not NULL value and that it matches the one specified in <code>EventType</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, they could unify the three different tables into one <strong>Entities</strong> table, which has a unique primary key, a field identifying the <code>EntityType</code> (Driver, Vehicle, Company, etc.), and all the fields from the current 3 tables (Some fields like <code>Name</code> could be unified, but most wont). The <code>EntityType</code> field would be a foreign key to an <strong>EntityType</strong> table, providing flexibility for potential future Types. In this case, the <strong>Events</strong> table is simplified, as it only needs the <code>EntityID</code> foreign key pointing to the <strong>Entities</strong> table.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There could be a third option as well: maintaining separate <strong>Event</strong> tables for each of the <strong>Drivers</strong>, <strong>Vehicles</strong>, and <strong>TransportCompanies</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, I'm simplifying the scenario, and it's worth noting that this is a legacy database where the <strong>Driver</strong>, <strong>Vehicle</strong>, and <strong>Company</strong> tables already exist as separate entities.</p>\n<p>To reiterate, I'm not seeking the best solution for this specific case but rather exploring the ideal way to model this if there were no constraints and the database could be designed from scratch.</p>\n"

What I tried to do at first was create a separate HTML doc for each page of my comic. I have found that most actual webcomics use some form of PHP, which I would love to learn, but may not have time for right now as I'm currently studying art, not coding. My question is (I suspect I know the answer but want to check): Can I just put each page on its own HTML file, or will that make my site horribly slow and janky? How many different pages can I put in my root folder and not kill my site?</p>\n<p>The site will probably have about 25 pages by the time I'm in a position to start learning PHP or other dynamic content techniques.</p>\n"

I would argue &quot;0c652e2a-ef02-4eff-8855-78122d8b6c0b &quot; is not a valid Guid because it has a trailing space.  The same argument can be made &quot;0c652e2a-ef02-4eff-8855-78122d8b6c0 b&quot; is also not a valid GUID.</p>\n<p>It seems like Microsoft library tries to be smart and trim trailing/leading spaces ....</p>\n"
